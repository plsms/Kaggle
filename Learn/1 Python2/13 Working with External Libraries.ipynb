The example above features something like **5** different overloaded operators. What's each of those operations doing? It can help to know the answer when things start going wrong."

      "source": "This turns out to be directly related to operator overloading.\n\nWhen Python programmers want to define how operators behave on their types, they do so by implementing methods with special names beginning and ending with 2 underscores such as `__lt__`, `__setattr__`, or `__contains__`. Generally, names that follow this double-underscore format have a special meaning to Python.\n\nSo, for example, the expression `x in [1, 2, 3]` is actually calling the list method `__contains__` behind-the-scenes. It's equivalent to (the much uglier) `[1, 2, 3].__contains__(x)`. \n\nIf you're curious to learn more, you can check out [Python's official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names), which describes many, many more of these special \"underscores\" methods.\n\nWe won't be defining our own types in these lessons (if only there was time!), but I hope you'll get to experience the joys of defining your own wonderful, weird types later down the road."
